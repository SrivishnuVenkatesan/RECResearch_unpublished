			<p>
				Rajalakshmi Institution leverages its research expertise to develop new methods
				that transform data into value. Analyzing large and complex data sets,
				also known as “big data,” can provide solutions to many challenges.
				Applying data analytics to social networks may help industries understand trends
				in consumer behaviors. Similar computational capabilities may also provide insight
				on tackling some of the most critical issues facing society today.
				Analytics in big data may lead to more confident decision making,
				and better decisions can mean greater operational efficiency, cost reduction and reduced risk.
